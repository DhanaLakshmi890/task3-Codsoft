To-Do List Project
The To-Do List Project is a Python application designed to help users manage and organize their daily tasks efficiently. The application provides basic functionalities such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks, making it a simple yet powerful tool for personal productivity. This project is an excellent starting point for beginners looking to enhance their Python programming skills and learn about fundamental programming concepts such as file handling, user input, and data management.

Project Overview
The To-Do List application allows users to maintain a list of tasks they need to accomplish. Tasks can be added, marked as complete, updated, or deleted as needed. This project is implemented using Python and is designed to run in a console environment, providing a straightforward interface for users to interact with.

Features
Add New Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list with a description and optionally, a due date.
View Tasks: Displays a list of all tasks, including their status (completed or pending) and due date (if any).
Update Tasks: Allows users to update the description or due date of existing tasks.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as completed, helping them track their progress.
Delete Tasks: Provides the option to remove tasks from the list once they are completed or no longer needed.
Data Persistence: Tasks are stored in a text file or database (e.g., SQLite), ensuring that the to-do list is saved across sessions.
Console-Based Interface: A simple, intuitive command-line interface guides users through the available options and operations.
Project Structure
The To-Do List application is organized into a single Python script with separate functions to handle each operation (e.g., add, view, update, delete, complete). This modular design makes it easy to maintain and extend the application by adding new features or modifying existing ones.
